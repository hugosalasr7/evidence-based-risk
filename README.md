# Evidence-Based Risk
Risk is a very popular and fun board game. I created this code to inform my decisions while playing it and increase my chances of winning. Specifically, the functions available in this repository estimate the probability that, given a number of attacking and defending troops, the player that's defending will lose all of her/his troops. Additionally, it computes the expected number of troops that are expected to go down under this mission.
